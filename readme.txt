This will allow you to change the seed of the challenges used in Rayman® Legends.

******* USAGE ********
To start editing the seed, launch seed_manager.exe (admin rights are maybe needed).
You have 4 hotkeys you can use:
	Press the 'S' key to start changing the seed (more informations below).
	Press the 'T' key to install the training room mod (more informations below).
	Press the 'H' key to open this file.
	Press the 'Q' key to exit the program.

******* CHANGING THE SEED ********
Before pressing the 'S' key, follow these steps:
- Be sure that the training room mod is installed! (more informations below)
- Start Rayman® Legends and go into a challenge in the training room.
- Wait until the countdown ("3, 2, 1, GO!") is finished.
- Pause the game, return on Seed Manager and NOW press the 'S' key.

The program is going to ask you if the running challenge is in the Dojo or not. Answer by pressing 'Y' (for yes) or 'N' (for no).
(Note: that's because the seed of the dojos is not located at the same "place" in the RAM as the other challenges types.)

Now the program is going to look for the seed in the game's memory. If it succeeds, the program will ask you to input the new seed that will replace the one currently in use.
(Note: you can find some of the seeds of the old challenges from the past here: http://goo.gl/Zspo6M )
TIP: If you want to paste a seed you have copied, right-click on the window then click 'Paste'.

Wait until the program says "Seed has been written successfully!".
Then go back on Rayman® Legends and restart the challenge. You should now be playing in the same challenge type, but with a different layout.

******* THE TRAINING ROOM ********
The training room is a room which is unaccessable in the game normally. It was a room that was likely used by the developers to test the challenges.
However, DJTHED found a glitch on the Wii U version of the game which allows you to access this room.
Since the PC version of this game is easily moddable, CaneofPacci was able to unlock this room on this version of the game.

The training room is called the "training" room because the name of the file it uses is called "training". It is a room that contains four functional paintings: The Neverending Pit, The Land of the Livid Dead, The Dojo and The Infinite Tower. Murfy's Dungeon is inaccessible due to technical reasons we are currently trying to resolve.
Each painting sends you in a challenge, letting you choose the event type ("As far as you can", "Grab them quickly" etc.) and the difficulty ("normal" or "expert"). The list may look like it repeats, and that's because the 2nd occurence of the challenge types are the weekly variants. The first occurence are the daily variants.

To avoid cheating, the training room MUST be installed to use this program for seed modification! The installation will also disable the suitcase menu, which will make you completely unable to access the default online challenges.
To install the training room mod, simply press the 'T' key in Seed Manager (Rayman® Legends should not be running in order to avoid data corruption or cheating).
To uninstall the training room mod, press 'T' again in Seed Manager. If it succeeds, the program should say "Training room has been (un)installed successfully!".
NOTE: Once in the game, if you can't go into the training room, try to launch Seed Manager with admin rights.

******* ERRORS ********
If you have problems, try doing the following.
- If you get errors in Seed Manager, be sure you did exactly what is written above!
- If your antivirus is telling you that Seed Manager is dangerous, it's because the program is messing with the RAM. Trust me, it's not dangerous! Just tell your antivirus that this program is fine.
- For Steam users: if you suddenly can't play Rayman® Legends anymore (that would be really unusual), first contact me and tell me what's happening. (Contact information below)
	Try to uninstall the training room. If it's still not working, go to C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/Rayman Legends/ and delete Bundle_PC.ipk.
	Then open Steam and right-click on Rayman® Legends > 'Properties' > 'Local files' > 'Verify integrity of game cache...'. Steam will then download Bundle_PC.ipk again.
  (For non-Steam users: I'd say backup your game save (My Documents/Rayman Legends/(Uplay Name)) and reinstall the game.)

If you are still having problems, simply go to the contact section below and send me a message. Do not hesitate! My program is in beta so it might not work all of the time.
